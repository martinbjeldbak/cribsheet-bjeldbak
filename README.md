cribsheet-bjeldbak
==================

My document class, cribsheetbjeldbak, extends the extarticle document class, extracting away tedious package settings and loads, bundling them together making it easier to just get started writing notes for any exam.

# Features

It adds/sets, among other things, the following:
  - Makes the cheat sheet landscape by default
  - Adds the ``col`` environment, splitting input up into 3 columns
  - Sets
  - Adds the ``nag``()
  - Loads the amazing [``booktabs``](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs) package to easily typeset prettier tables
